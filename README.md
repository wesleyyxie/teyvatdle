Welcome to [**Teyvatdle**](https://teyvatdle.net), a website inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Loldle](https://loldle.net/) to test your knowledge on Genshin Impact characters. Check it out at [teyvatdle.net](https://teyvatdle.net).

## How to Play

1. **Choose a Category**: Teyvatdle offers four game modes to test different aspects of your Genshin Impact character knowledge. Pick one to get started:
   - **Classic**: Guess the character based on their attributes
   - **Voiceline**: Guess the character based on an in-game voiceline
   - **Ability**: Guess the character based on an image of one of their talents
   - **Spy**: Guess the character based on lower quality images of their splash art

2. **Make a Guess**: Enter the name of a Genshin Impact character. Teyvatdle will provide feedback to help you get closer to the answer:
   - Each hint will indicate if you're getting closer to the answer.
   - Use the information to refine your future guesses.

3. **Solve It**: Keep guessing based on given hints and clues until you unveil the correct character in the least amount of attempts possible!

4. **Keep Your Streak**: Make sure to play and win everyday to maintain your daily streak!
