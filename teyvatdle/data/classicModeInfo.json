During this effect's duration, it will deal Cryo DMG to affected opponents at intervals.\nHold\nPopping Monsieur Verite's viewfinder open, Charlotte enters Composition Mode, and during this time, the viewfinder will expand as you hold until you reach a Finisher Frame state. In this state, Charlotte can move and change direction freely.\nWhen the hold state ends, Monsieur Verite will deal Cryo DMG to all opponents locked on within the viewfinder, and apply the same Snappy Silhouette as Tap Mode does to them. If you unleash this ability only after reaching Finisher Frame, you will instead apply Focused Impression, which lasts longer and deals more DMG, although the Skill CD will be longer.\nComposition Mode lasts a maximum of 15s and allows a maximum of 5 opponents to be selected.\n\"Press photography requires simple shots with exceptional theming, but most of all, you need to have a knack for capturing the moment!\"",

The DMG done through the aforementioned method is considered Normal Attack DMG.\nSwift Hunt\nWhen her Bond of Life is equal to or greater than 100% of her max HP: Performs a pistolet shot.\nWhen her Bond of Life is less than 100%, firing her pistolet will grant her Bond of Life, with the amount gained based on her max HP. The shots she fires can pierce opponents, and DMG dealt to opponents in their path is increased.\nImpale the Night\nThe current percentage value of Clorinde's Bond of Life determines its effect:\nWhen the Bond of Life value is 0%, perform a normal lunging strike;\nWhen the Bond of Life value is less than 100% of her max HP, Clorinde is healed based on the Bond of Life value, and the AoE of the lunging attack and the DMG dealt is increased;\nWhen the value of the Bond of Life is equal to or greater than 100% of her max HP, use Impale the Night: Pact. The healing multiplier is increased, and the AoE and DMG dealt by the lunge is increased even further.\nIn addition, when Clorinde is in the Night Vigil state, healing effects other than Impale the Night will not take effect and will instead be converted into a Bond of Life that is a percentage of the healing that would have been received.\nClorinde will exit the \"Night Vigil\" state when she leaves the field.\nArkhe: Ousia\nPeriodically, when Clorinde's Swift Hunt shots strike opponents, she will summon a Surging Blade at the position hit that deals Ousia-aligned Electro DMG.\nThough the evil that lurked in the shadows of the night had been purged across thousands of years, a shadow that the light could not reach clouded human hearts.\nEven now, the warning left by the Golden Hunter is etched into her memory: Those of the Night Vigil, carrying aloft lit candles against the blackness, have greater need still to remain vigilant. Be not corrupted by the cold dark.",

This effect will replace his default sprint.\n- Jumping expends extra Kuugoryoku Points to increase hovering height.

This DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.\nEach use of Skyladder while in this state increases the DMG and AoE of the next Driftcloud Wave used.\n\nSkyladder\nCan be used while in mid-air. Xianyun leaps forward, dealing Anemo DMG to targets along her path.\n\nDuring each Cloud Transmogrification state Xianyun enters, Skyladder may be used up to 3 times and only 1 instance of Skyladder DMG can be dealt to any one opponent.\nIf Skyladder is not used again in a short period, the Cloud Transmogrification state will be canceled.\nIf Xianyun does not use Driftcloud Wave while in this state, the next CD of White Clouds at Dawn will be decreased by 3s.",
